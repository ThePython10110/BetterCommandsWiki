  The scoreboard system is a complex gameplay mechanic utilized through
  commands. Mainly intended for mapmakers and server operators, scoreboards are
  used to track, set, and list the scores of players.

# Scoreboard

## Objectives

Entities can hold scores in the scoreboard specified by objective. Objectives track a number of points for entities while meeting a single criteria. Objective scores are stored as integers with the range of -99,999,999,999,999 to 100,000,000,000,000 (-100 trillion + 1 to 100 trillion)

Objectives have two main properties: a name and a criterion. The objective's name is used internally for referencing in commands and selector arguments. And the criterion determines its behavior â€” primarily what to track.

Objective names must be single words containing only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

The entity's score in any objective can be changed from commands. It can be increased by, decreased by, or set to a given amount with commands.  Currently, only players are supported, and not other entities. However, "fake players" can also be used.

Objectives also have other properties to customize their appearance and behavior:

| Property     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| displayname  | Specify the objective's display name that appears in the sidebar and as the result of some commands. By default, the objective's name is the display name.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| numberformat | <p>Specify the objective's number format for the score. The number format can be blank, fixed, and styled.</p><p>Blank number format displays nothing on the scoreboard. Fixed number format displays the contents specified in the command.</p><p>Styled number format displays the score number with the color specified in the command.</p> |

The number format property and the score holder's name can be changed per-entity using `/scoreboard players display numberformat|name <target> ...`

## Criteria

These criteria's names consist of a single alphabetical string.

| Criteria name   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dummy           | Score that can be changed only by commands, and not automatically by the game. This can be used for storing integer states and variables, which then can be used with the scoreboard's operations to do arithmetic calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| trigger         | Score that can be changed by commands, and not automatically by the game. The `/trigger` command can be used by players to set or increment and decrement their own score. The command fails if the objective has not been "enabled" for the player using it. If the player uses it, the objective is automatically disabled for them afterward. By default, all trigger objectives are disabled for any players. Ordinary players can use the `/trigger` command, even if cheats are disabled or if they are not server operators, in which case this is useful for safely taking non-operator player input. |
| deathCount      | Score increments automatically for a player when they die.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| playerKillCount | Score increments automatically for a player when they kill another player.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| health          | Represents the amount of health/HP the player has                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

**Compound criteria**

Compound criteria's names are divided into parts, delimited with periods (.). For example, `killed_by.mobs_mc:zombie` is a valid compound criteria, under which player scores would increment whenever they're killed by a zombie.

<table><thead><tr><th width="315">Criteria base name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>teamkill.&#x3C;team_color></code></td><td><p>Player scores increment when a player kills a member of the given colored team.</p><p>These criteria follow the complete format <code>teamkill.&#x3C;team_color></code>, where <code>&#x3C;team_color></code> is a valid team color.</p></td></tr><tr><td><code>killedByTeam.&#x3C;team_color></code></td><td><p>Player scores increment when killed by a member of the given colored team.</p><p>These criteria follow the complete format <code>killedByTeam.&#x3C;team_color></code>, where <code>&#x3C;team_color></code> is a valid team color.</p></td></tr><tr><td><code>killed_by.&#x3C;entity></code></td><td>Player scores increment when killed by the specified entity. <code>&#x3C;entity></code> can be any entity or <a href="entity-aliases.md">entity alias</a>, or <code>player</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code>picked_up.&#x3C;item></code></td><td>Player scores increment when picking up the specified item. <code>&#x3C;item></code> can be any itemstring or alias, <code>group:&#x3C;groupname></code>, or <code>*</code> to match any item. Scores are incremented by one for each itemstack picked up, regardless of how many items are in the itemstack.</td></tr><tr><td><code>mined.&#x3C;node></code> or <code>dug.&#x3C;node></code></td><td>Player scores increment when digging the specified node. <code>&#x3C;node></code> can be any itemstring or alias, <code>group:&#x3C;groupname></code>, or <code>*</code> to match any node.</td></tr><tr><td><code>placed.&#x3C;node></code></td><td>Player scores increment when placing the specified node. <code>&#x3C;node></code> can be any itemstring or alias, <code>group:&#x3C;groupname></code>, or <code>*</code> to match any node.</td></tr><tr><td><code>crafted.&#x3C;item></code></td><td>Player scores increment when crafting the specified item. <code>&#x3C;item></code> can be any itemstring or alias, <code>group:&#x3C;groupname></code>, or <code>*</code> to match any item. Scores are incremented by one for each craft, regardless of how many items are crafted.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## # Display slots

Via the `/scoreboard objectives setdisplay` command, players' scores in specific objectives can be displayed in certain 'slots' in-game. Each 'display slot' can show one objective at a time, and multiple 'display slots' may be used for the same or different objectives.

<table><thead><tr><th width="189">Slot</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>sidebar</td><td>Shows on the right hand side of the screen. Shows up to 15 entities with the highest score of that objective with a heading labeled with the objective's &#x3C;DisplayName>. Note that players are shown even if offline, and untracked players are not shown. In addition, fake players with names starting with a # do not show up in the sidebar under any circumstances. The sidebar's refresh rate is dependent on the "Better Commands save interval" setting (default: 3 seconds).</td></tr><tr><td>sidebar.team.&#x3C;color> â€Œ</td><td>There are 16 team-specific sidebar display slots. These operate the same as the standard sidebar slot, but display only to players who are on teams that use the specified color (for example, "sidebar.team.green" displays to players on "green" teams). <code>&#x3C;color></code> must be a valid team color.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Teams

A team is a list of players (or fake players) that can be used by mapmakers or server operators to group players together as allies.

Players can only have one team; teams cannot share members.

Teams have a **name** property, used internally for reference in commands. It is a single word containing only alphanumeric characters and underscores. Teams also have several other properties to customize their appearence and behavior:

| Property     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Value                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| friendlyFire | Allow whether or not member can attack other member on the same team. In non-MineClone games, this only affects direct damage (so not, for example, damage dealt with a bow).                                                           | Boolean (defaults to true)                                                                                                                                                                    |
| nameFormat   | Specifies the team's name format. Any instance of `%s` is replaced with the player's name. For example, a player named ThePython on a team with the nameFormat of `[ADMIN] %s the Great` would appear as `[ADMIN] ThePython the Great`. | Long string                                                                                                                                                                                   |
