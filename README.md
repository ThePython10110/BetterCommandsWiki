Welcome to the Better Commands wiki! This wiki is (I think) fully up-to-date with v3.0 of the mod.

For command blocks that work with Better Commands, use the [Better Command Blocks](https://content.luanti.org/packages/ThePython/better_command_blocks/) mod.

A lot of this is basically copied from ACOVG's wiki, since it's basically the same information.

{% hint style="info" %}
ACOVG ("A Certain Other Voxel Game") is used in place of the game from which I'm copying the commands, because that's how I decided to do it.
{% endhint %}
